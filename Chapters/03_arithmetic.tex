\chapter{Arithmetic Operations}\label{arith}

\section{Purpose}

This lab develops an arithmetic unit that includes eight different arithmetic functions using both \LE library items and gate-level logic. This device will eventually be used as part of the \acf{ALU} in Lab \ref{alu}.

\section{Procedure}

Start a new \LE project and create a new subcircuit named \lstinline[columns=fixed]|arithmetic|.

\section{Deliverable}

To receive a grade for this lab, complete the circuit. Be sure the standard identifying information is at the top left of the \lstinline{main} circuit, similar to:
