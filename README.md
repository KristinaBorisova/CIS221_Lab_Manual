# Cochise College CIS 221: Lab Manual

This is the lab manual for the Cochise College CIS 221, Digital Logic, class. The labs use the *Logisim-evolution* simulator and are designed to teach all aspects of both combinational and sequential logic circuits.

* Lab 1: Introduction to *Logisim-evolution*: Students create a simple 2-Way, 1-Bit Multiplexer to learn how to work with the simulator.
* Lab 2: Adder: This lab builds a full 1-bit adder, but the intent is to continue to familiarize students with _Logisim-Evolution_ and how basic arithmetic functions can be completed using simple gate-level logic. Additionally, this lab develops an automated testing system that will be used to test future lab submissions.
* Lab 3: Arithmetic Operations: This lab develops an arithmetic unit that includes eight different arithmetic functions using _Logisim-Evolution_ library components. This device will eventually be used as part of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Lab 8. 
* Lab 4: Logic Operations: This lab develops a logic unit that includes eight different logic functions using _Logisim-Evolution_ library components. This device will eventually be used as part of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Lab 8.
* Lab 5: Boolean Logic: The goal for this lab is to design circuits when given a Boolean expression. This is normally called “realizing” a circuit; that is, making a real circuit from a Boolean expression.
* Lab 6: Programmable Logic Array (PLA): This lab explores using a Programmable Logic Array (PLA) to simplify circuits that are designed for Boolean operations. A PLA is an Integrated Circuit (IC) that contains an array of AND and OR gates that can be linked in whatever way the circuit designer needs. A single PLA can replace dozens of other gates and greatly simplify circuit design.
* Lab 7: Counters: This lab has two goals. 1) Develop several different common asynchronous and synchronous counters using D ﬂip-ﬂops. 2) Introduce the _Logisim-Evolution_ chronogram feature that generates a timing diagram as a sequential circuit functions.
* Lab 8: Arithmatic-Logic Unit (ALU): This lab creates an ALU using the arithmetic and logic circuits developed in Labs 3 and 4.
* Lab 9: Priority Encoder: Often a circuit will receive data from several sources at one time and there must be a way to prioritize those inputs. This circuit creates a simple priority encoder for nine different inputs. 
* Lab 10: Timer: This lab creates a timer where the minimum and maximum counts can be set and counts both up and down. 
* Lab 11: ROM: This lab demonstrates how ROM works. The circuit builds a "Magic 8-ball" simulator and uses saying pre-loaded in ROM to respond to the user's yes/no questions.
* Lab 12: Vending Machine: This lab builds a vending machine simulation that meets certain specifications. 
* Lab 13: Processor: A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is arguably one of the most important digital logic devices and the purpose of this lab is to lay the foundation of CPU operations.
* Lab 14: Elevator: This is a capstone project where the specifications for a simple elevator simulator are given and the circuit must be developed "from scratch."
